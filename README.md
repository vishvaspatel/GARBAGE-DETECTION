## üí• Introduction

Garbage collection is a challenging task that requires significant effort and manpower. This project proposes an **automatic garbage detection system** utilizing CCTV cameras installed on streets. The system leverages deep learning models to detect garbage piles and send alerts to relevant authorities, helping to maintain cleaner urban environments efficiently.

The proposed work includes the generation of a **handcrafted dataset** containing images of garbage piles. Deep learning models such as **YOLOv5n, YOLOv7-tiny, and YOLOv8n** are employed for object detection, ensuring high accuracy in identifying garbage locations.

## üí° Why did we build this?

- **Efficient Garbage Management:** Reduces dependency on manual monitoring.
- **Automated Alerts:** Sends notifications to municipal authorities for quick action.
- **Smart City Integration:** Supports real-time waste management solutions.
- **Deep Learning Implementation:** Enhances detection accuracy through advanced AI models.

## üåü Features

- **Real-time Garbage Detection** using YOLO deep learning models.
- **Automated Alert System** that notifies municipal authorities.
- **Web Dashboard** for monitoring garbage locations and reports.
- **CCTV Camera Integration** for real-time image processing.
- **Data Augmentation** techniques to enhance model training.
- **User Authentication** for secure access to the platform.

## üìÇ Dataset Collection and Preparation

As per our study, **no suitable datasets** containing images of garbage piles were available. Hence, we created a **custom dataset** with manually gathered and annotated images. The dataset preparation process includes:

- **1000 original images** collected from CCTV footage at different times of the day.
- **Manual annotation** using the **LabelImg** tool.
- **Data Augmentation Techniques** applied: Flip, Rotate (90¬∞), Shear, Exposure, Blur, and Noise.
- **Final dataset size:** 5000 images (1000 original + 4000 augmented images).

## üõ†Ô∏è System Workflow

1. CCTV footage is processed in real-time.
2. Frames are extracted and passed through YOLO models.
3. Garbage piles are detected with bounding boxes.
4. Alerts are sent to relevant municipal authorities.

## üèóÔ∏è Methodology

### A. Proposed Approach

This research methodology involves utilizing **real-time images** captured from CCTV cameras as input data. These images are employed to train deep learning models using **YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8**, which are well-known for their object detection capabilities.

- The trained model's efficiency is evaluated using the train dataset.
- The developed model can detect real-time garbage, as shown in Figure 4.
- If garbage is detected within the input images, an **automatic alert is sent to the relevant authorities** to ensure timely action.
